# The-Boots-Bootique
**Challenge Projects of CodeCademy**

CREATE REST APIS WITH SPRING AND JAVA
The Boots Bootique
A dazzling new shop, the Boots Bootique, is set to open their flagship store on Spring Street this spring. However, they’ve got no way to manage all their inventory just yet! The store owns a vast collection of boots of all different sizes, types, materials, and quantities. Help the shop create their inventorying system in time for their shop’s opening.
For this project, we won’t have to touch the code in the frontend. All that we’ll do is use Spring Data JPA to complete the functionality for the Boots API so that the frontend can:
Create new boots
Read and search the boots in the inventory
Update the number of any given boot in the inventory
Delete boots from the inventory
The controller has already been implemented for all the endpoints that the frontend depends on. All you’ll need to do is fill out the model and add in the correct calls to your repository interface methods.
We’ll also have you use an enum type in the model, which lets you predefine a set of known constants, like the days of the week or colors in the rainbow. You can read more about enums in the Oracle documentation.
If, at any point, your website goes “blank”, your Spring server may be malfunctioning. First, check that you have no compilation errors by running mvn compile in the terminal. Fix all errors in your code, and run your code before executing the command pkill ein in the terminal to reset the server. Your browser will disconnect and reconnect to Codecademy.
